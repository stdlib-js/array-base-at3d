    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Usage

```javascript
import at3d from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-at3d@deno/mod.js';
```

#### at3d( x, i0, i1, i2 )

Returns an element from a three-dimensional nested array.

```javascript
var x = [ [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ] ];

var out = at3d( x, 0, 0, 1 );
// returns 2

out = at3d( x, 0, 1, 0 );
// returns 3
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **x**: three-dimensional nested input array.
-   **i0**: first dimension index.
-   **i1**: second dimension index.
-   **i2**: third dimension index.

<!-- Package usage notes. Make sure to keep an empty line after the `section` element and another before the `/section` close. -->

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   Negative indices are resolved relative to the last element along the respective dimension, with the last element corresponding to `-1`.
-   If provided out-of-bounds indices, the function always returns `undefined`.

```javascript
import papply from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/utils-papply@deno/mod.js';
var discreteUniform = require( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/random-base-discrete-uniform' ).factory;

import zeros3d from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-zeros3d@deno/mod.js';
import at3d from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-at3d@deno/mod.js';

var shape = [ 3, 3, 3 ];

// Define a nested input array:
var x = filled3dBy( shape, discreteUniform( -100, 100 ) );
console.log( x );

// Define arrays containing random index values:
var i0 = filled3dBy( shape, discreteUniform( -shape[0], shape[0]-1 ) );
console.log( i0 );

var i1 = filled3dBy( shape, discreteUniform( -shape[1], shape[1]-1 ) );
console.log( i1 );

var i2 = filled3dBy( shape, discreteUniform( -shape[2], shape[2]-1 ) );
console.log( i2 );

// Define an output array:
var out = zeros3d( shape );
console.log( out );

// Fill the output array with randomly selected values from the input array:
ternary3d( [ i0, i1, i2, out ], shape, papply( at3d, x ) );
console.log( out );
